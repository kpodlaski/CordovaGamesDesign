William Blake (28 November 1757 - 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age. What he called his prophetic works were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form <i>what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language</i>. His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him <i>far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced</i>. In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham, he produced a diverse and symbolically rich ouvre, which embraced the imagination as <i>the body of God</i> or <i>human existence itself</i>.

	Tyger Tyger, burning bright, <br>
	In the forests of the night; <br>
	What immortal hand or eye,  <br>
	Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

<p id="Stanza2" style="display:none">
	In what distant deeps or skies,<br> 
	Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
	On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
	What the hand, dare seize the fire?
